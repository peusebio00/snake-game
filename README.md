# snake-game
In this project, I have programmed the Snake Game, just like the one you could play on old Nokia 3310's

I did this through OOP with 'snake', 'food', 'screen' and 'scoreboard' classes

This was possible through the Python Turtle package, which gives Python a GUI component, which interacts with the user and, in this case, listens to keyboard clicks -
- ("Up", "Down", "Left", "Right" arrows) to give the user the ability to control the snake
